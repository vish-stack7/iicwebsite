                  <p ><br/>When the University of Delhi expanded in many directions to keep pace with a rapidly growing city, South Campus was established in 1973 to facilitate access for South Delhi residents. It moved to its present location on Benito Juarez Road, near Dhaula Kuan, in 1984. The Campus is now spread across 69 acres of green, hilly terrain and its buildings blend attractively with the natural surroundings. The various Departments are located in the Arts Faculty, the Faculty of Inter-disciplinary and Applied Sciences and the S.P. Jain Centre for Management Studies. Besides these, the Campus hosts a substantial library, a Health Centre, a bank, a post office, DTC Pass Section and administrative and examination blocks. South Campus also provides some residential quarters for faculty members and the non-teaching staff. Outstation students are offered accommodation in three hostels: the Geetanjali Hostel for Women, the Saramati Hostel for Men and the Aravalli P.G. Menâ€™s Hostel</p>
