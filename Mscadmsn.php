            Master of Science (Informatics) - Two-year degree programme
         </h3>
         <p style="text-align:center;text-align:justify;"><br>
            The two-year post-graduate degree programme provides students theoretical knowledge and practical skills relating to computers, programming languages, graphics and multimedia applications, telecommunication systems, networking, and management of information systems. The students, after completing the two-year programme, are expected to attain a good background in conventional computer programming, and expertise in computers and telecommunication networks. To supplement the academic inputs, it is mandatory for all the students to undergo practical training (summer training/ project) in house or in a business/ industrial/ research organisation, at the end of II or IV semester of the programme. Students who successfully complete a total of 138 credits, from all the four semesters and summer training, are awarded the degree of M.Sc. in Informatics.
         </p>
         <p style="text-align:center;text-align:justify;"><br>
            Since the students come from different disciplines, to bring them at par before starting the regular courses, a zero semester of about one-month has been introduced. During the Zero semester, students take courses in topics in which they do not have an adequate background and are exposed to laboratory and Internet. Out of various papers specified for the zero semester a minimum of two papers have to be taken by every student and depending on the background, a student may be advised to take more than two papers. Zero semester papers do not carry any credit for the purpose of classification of results. This period is also used for training students needing financial assistance to work as teaching or administrative assistants.
